###  Design a simple Social Media application(Maven Project)


#### Users should be able to:

1.       create new posts

2.       follow/unfollow another user

3.       view the 20 most recent posts in the user's news feed.


#### Design should support the following methods:

1. Compose a new post
> createPost(userId, postId, content)

2. Retrieve the 20 most recent post ids in the user's news feed. Each item in the news feed must be posted either by one of the userâ€™s followees or by the user herself. Posts must be ordered by posting time starting from the most recent one.
> getNewsFeed(userId)

3. Follower follows a followee
>follow(followerId, followeeId)

4. Unfollower follows a followee
>unfollow (followerId, followeeId)



#### To achive this I have used below librares/ reposetories.

- Swagger2 & Swagger UI : API documentations and Rest API call
- slf4J : Log.
- lombok : Boiler code.
- h2database : For inmemory database.
- mockito : For test cases


## FEW REQUIRD URLS

1. API documentations and Rest API call
> http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

2. Database access
> http://localhost:8080/h2-console/   (user: sa and password: password)
